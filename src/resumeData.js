    "aboutme":"Hi all! The journey of my software career began in high school where I studied Java for 2 years and then self-taught Objective-C for a year. Onto college at the University of Texas at Austin where I began as a computer science student while also taking an entry level teaching class. My passion soon switched to teaching and I shifted my studies to physics and math as to become a high school teacher! 3 years later, after countless 60+ hour work weeks, underappreciation, and a less than impressive salary, I am deciding to switch careers to help better my family's and my future. I am a big fan of the logic and algorithms in back-end development, and look forward to cracking jokes and working with a team on some exciting projects. In my off-time I heavily enjoy the outdoors, cooking, and music.",
