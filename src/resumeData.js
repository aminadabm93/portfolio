Onto college at the University of Texas at Austin where I began as a computer science student while also leading study groups. I felt a calling to give back to society and shifted my studies to physics and mathemathics as to become a high school teacher! 3 years later and I decided to switch careers because I miss working with a team on challenging puzzles. I am a happiest on a team that takes pride in ownership and philanthropy. In my off-time I heavily enjoy the outdoors, cooking, and music.",
