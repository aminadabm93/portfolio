    "aboutme":"Hi all! The journey of my software career began in high school where I studied Java for 2 years and then self-taught Objective-C for a year. Onto college at the University of Texas at Austin where I began as a computer science student while also leading study groups. I felt a calling to give back to society and shifted my studies to physics and mathemathics as to become a high school teacher! 3 years later and I am deciding to switch careers because I miss working with a team on challenging puzzles. I miss creating a product that can benefit real world users.  I am a big fan of the logic and algorithms in back-end development, and look forward to cracking jokes and working with a team on some exciting projects. In my off-time I heavily enjoy the outdoors, cooking, and music.",
